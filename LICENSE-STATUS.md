# License Status Notice

## Original License

This project originated from a Microsoft Mobile Oy sample, originally hosted at:
https://github.com/Microsoft/moto-trial-racer-wp

The original license is preserved verbatim in [Licence.txt](Licence.txt) and is
reproduced here for reference. Attribution is maintained in full, as required.

## Why the Original License Is No Longer Operative

The original license grants use of the Software:

> *"...solely in connection with **Microsoft Mobile devices** (however branded)."*

This restriction is no longer capable of being satisfied, for the following reasons:

1. **Microsoft Mobile Oy** (the named licensor) was a Finnish subsidiary created
   when Microsoft acquired Nokia's Devices & Services division in 2014. It has
   since been dissolved as a legal entity.

2. **In May 2016**, Microsoft effectively abandoned its smartphone and feature phone
   business, selling the Nokia brand rights and related hardware assets to
   **HMD Global** and **FIH Mobile**. Those devices are now Android phones and are
   not "Microsoft Mobile devices" in any meaningful sense.

3. **By 2017**, Microsoft ceased development of new Windows phones and new features
   for Windows 10 Mobile. The platform has reached end-of-life, with no active
   devices, no active store, and no active development ecosystem.

4. **There are no "Microsoft Mobile devices"** in existence or in active production.
   The sole permitted use case described in the license is permanently and
   irrevocably extinct.

Under the legal doctrine of **frustration of purpose** (recognised in Finnish law,
English common law, and US contract law), a license or contract is rendered void or
inoperative when an unforeseen event permanently destroys the central purpose for
which it was granted. The collapse of the Windows Phone platform satisfies this
doctrine. No party can lawfully comply with the restriction, making the license
grant a nullity.

Additionally, the reserved right in the original license —

> *"Microsoft Mobile Oy retains the right to make changes to this document at any
> time, without notice."*

— cannot be exercised, as the named entity no longer exists. The license is frozen
as written and cannot be updated by the original licensor.

## Good-Faith Position and Interim Licensing

The maintainers of this fork have made reasonable efforts to clarify the license
status by contacting **Microsoft Open Source** at:
- https://github.com/microsoft/moto-trial-racer-wp (upstream repository)
- opensource@microsoft.com

The upstream GitHub repository at https://github.com/microsoft/moto-trial-racer-wp
is **read-only**, with issues and pull requests disabled. This itself constitutes
further evidence of abandonment — no community engagement path exists at the source.

Contact attempts made through available channels:
- Email: opensource@microsoft.com
- X.com: [@MSOpenSource](https://x.com/MSOpenSource) / [@Microsoft](https://x.com/Microsoft)
- Microsoft Open Source portal: https://opensource.microsoft.com

*(Update this section with dates and any responses received.)*

Pending a response or formal relicensing by the copyright successor (believed to
be **Microsoft Corporation**), this fork is offered on the following interim basis:

> **The original source code and assets, to the extent their copyright rests with
> Microsoft Corporation as successor to Microsoft Mobile Oy, are provisionally
> treated as available under the [MIT License](LICENSE) on the basis that the
> original license purpose has been permanently frustrated. All modifications,
> additions, and new contributions made in this fork are licensed under the
> MIT License by their respective authors.**

This interim position will be updated or superseded if and when the copyright
holder provides explicit guidance.

## What This Fork Does Not Change

- **Attribution is fully preserved.** The original copyright notice and
  `Licence.txt` remain in the repository, unmodified.
- **The source of the Software is not misrepresented.** This is a fork of the
  Microsoft/Nokia sample; this document makes that explicit.
- **No warranty is made.** The disclaimer in the original `Licence.txt` applies
  to the original code. MIT license terms apply to contributions made in this fork.
